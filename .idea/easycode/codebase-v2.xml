It leverages common functionality from the base CommonDefinitions class.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/UI/common/CommonDefinitions.java\&quot;:\&quot;This CommonDefinitions.java file contains common utility methods for interacting with elements on web pages using Selenium.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- wait10AndClick() - Waits up to 10 seconds for an element to be clickable and then clicks it\\n\\n- elementIsDisplayed() - Asserts that an element is displayed on the page\\n\\n- insertKeywoardIntoField() - Waits for a field to be clickable, clears it, and inserts a keyword \\n\\n- selectDropdownByValue() - Selects an option from a dropdown by value\\n\\n- iPress() - Presses the Enter key or fails if an unsupported key is passed\\n\\nThe purpose of this file is to define reusable helper methods for common Selenium tasks like waiting for elements, interacting with elements, validating elements are present, etc. This avoids duplicating code across test classes and makes the tests cleaner and more readable.\\n\\nThe key functions help with waiting for elements, inputting data, selecting options, and simulating keyboard events - which are very common tasks when automating tests with Selenium.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/test/java/Algorithms_Tests/SmallestDistanceProblem.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file contains an algorithm to find the index of the first number in the pair of adjacent numbers with the smallest distance (absolute difference) in a given integer array.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- findIndexWithSmallestDistance(int[] array):\\n  - Takes an integer array as input\\n  - Loops through the array comparing the absolute difference of adjacent numbers\\n  - Keeps track of the minimum distance seen and its corresponding index\\n  - Returns the index of the first number in the pair with the smallest distance\\n\\n- main(String[] args):\\n  - Defines a sample integer array\\n  - Calls findIndexWithSmallestDistance() on the array\\n  - Prints out the result\\n\\nSo in summary, it implements an algorithm to find the index of the first number in the pair of adjacent numbers with the smallest absolute difference (distance) in a given array. It has a main method to test it on a sample input.\&quot;,\&quot;/readme.md\&quot;:\&quot;This readme.md file provides documentation and instructions for a test automation project.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n- Provides an overview of the project structure - it outlines the main folders and what they contain. This helps new users understand how the project is organized.\\n\\n- Explains the usage/how to run the tests. It provides instructions for running the UI and algorithms tests from within the project. \\n\\n- Documents the common definitions folder - this contains reusable functions/code that is used across multiple test files. Having common code in one place is a best practice.\\n\\n- Documents the pages folder - this contains page object model files that represent the UI elements on web pages as objects. This is a common pattern in UI test automation.\\n\\n- Identifies the test cases folder - this contains the actual test files that define and group the test scenarios/cases to be run.\\n\\nSo in summary, the key functions of this readme file are:\\n\\n1. Provide an overview of the project structure\\n2. Explain how to run/execute the tests \\n3. Document any common/reusable code components\\n4. Identify where key artifacts like page objects and test cases are located\\n\\nIt serves as onboarding documentation for new users of the automation project.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/main/java/UI/pages/HomeBundlesPage.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file defines a HomeBundlesPage class that represents the home bundles page in the UI. \\n\\nIt extends the CommonDefinitions class which likely contains common/reusable UI interaction methods.\\n\\nThe key functions of this class are:\\n\\n- bundles() method:\\n  - Clicks on the bundles button \\n  - Clicks on the car button\\n  - Enters search criteria like fly from, fly to, dates etc\\n  - Selects departure and return times\\n  - Clicks find a deal button to submit the search\\n\\n- It defines locators (By objects) for common page elements like buttons, fields etc\\n\\n- Reuses methods from CommonDefinitions like wait10AndClick(), insertKeywoardIntoField() etc to interact with elements\\n\\n- Handles waits/sleeps between interactions\\n\\nThe purpose of this class is to encapsulate and abstract away the UI interactions needed to perform a bundles search on the home page. It provides a high level method bundles() that can be called from tests to perform an end-to-end search flow without dealing with low level Selenium commands.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/test/java/UI_Test_Cases/TestCases.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file contains UI test cases for a web application using the TestNG framework:\\n\\n- It defines a TestCases class that extends the CommonDefinitions class, which likely contains common methods/variables used across test cases.\\n\\n- The @BeforeClass annotation marks the setUp() method, which launches the browser, navigates to the URL, deletes cookies and maximizes the window. This setup is run once before any tests.\\n\\n- The @Test annotated testFlow() method:\\n\\n  - Calls the bundles() method on the HomeBundlesPage object to interact with the bundles page\\n  - Calls the result() method on the ResultsPage object to interact with the results page\\n\\n- The @AfterClass annotated tearDown() method closes the browser after all tests have run. \\n\\n- It initializes page object instances for the HomeBundlesPage and ResultsPage. Page objects encapsulate elements and actions for each page.\\n\\n- It uses the WebDriverManager dependency to automatically configure the ChromeDriver binary.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Test case setup and teardown \\n- Page object modeling for abstraction \\n- Navigation between pages under test\\n- TestNG annotations for test execution order and grouping\\n- CommonDefinitions class for shared code\\n\\nSo in summary, it sets up and runs an end-to-end UI test scenario using the page object pattern and TestNG framework.\&quot;,\&quot;/src/test/java/Algorithms_Tests/AnagramProblem.java\&quot;:\&quot;This Java file contains a program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other:\\n\\n- areAnagrams() method:\\n  - Removes whitespace and converts both strings to lowercase\\n  - Sorts the character arrays of both strings \\n  - Compares the sorted character arrays using Arrays.equals()\\n  - Returns true if equal, false otherwise\\n\\n- main() method:\\n  - Defines two sample strings to test\\n  - Calls areAnagrams() method passing the strings\\n  - Prints result indicating if they are anagrams or not\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- areAnagrams(): Checks if two strings are anagrams by preprocessing, sorting characters and comparing\\n- main(): Entry point of program that tests areAnagrams() on sample input\\n\\nSo in summary, it contains a method to check for anagrams by preprocessing and comparing sorted character arrays, and a main method to test it on sample input strings.\&quot;,\&quot;/pom.xml\&quot;:\&quot;This pom.xml file is the project object model file that defines the Maven configuration and dependencies for a Maven project.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Defines the project coordinates like groupId, artifactId, version etc. This identifies the project.\\n\\n- Defines properties for common versions of dependencies that are reused. This avoids duplicating versions.\\n\\n- Defines dependencies on external libraries like JUnit, Cucumber, Selenium, Jackson etc that the project needs. \\n\\n- Defines the Java version and encoding to use for compiling the project.\\n\\n- Defines plugins like maven-compiler-plugin to compile Java code.\\n\\n- Provides configuration for the compiler plugin like source/target Java version and encoding.\\n\\n- Describes the overall project structure and configuration that Maven needs to build, test and manage the project.\\n\\n- Allows Maven to download all dependencies automatically by reading the dependency information from pom.xml.\\n\\n- Standardizes the build process by providing a common project configuration file that Maven understands.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides all the configuration that Maven needs to build the project, manage dependencies and standardize the build/test process.\&quot;}&quot;}" />
